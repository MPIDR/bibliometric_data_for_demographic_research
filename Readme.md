3.	Description of workshop objectives, goals, and expected outcomes. 
    - Overview of literature on using bibliometric data for demographic research and potential research projects and some of the newest bibliometric applications
    - Introduction to available data sources, especially publicly available data
    - Introduction to handling bibliometric data for demographic research: data retrieval, data pre-processing and repurposing based on research questions
    - Discussion about potential limitation and future directions of bibliometric data in demographic research

4.	Statement on how the workshop can benefit attendees. 
    - Familiarize themselves with the availability of bibliometric data as a type of digital data and its potentials for demographic research
    - Familiarize themselves with the most commonly used and available bibliometric databases
    - Learn about pre-processing steps and handling bibliometric data, including: 
        - Author/organisation name disambiguation 
        - Gender identification
        - Scholarly mobility and movement identification
        - Detecting missing countries, assigning scientific disciplines (to papers and at authors level based on publications in their career)
    - Learn about practical applications of bibliometric data in demographic research, including:
        - Use of some relevant scientometric indicators (N of publications, N of co-authors, citations, 3-year citations, FSS, (fractional scientific strength))
        - Calculation and use of demographic indicators (e.g., N and population of active scholars, stock and flows of scholars, academic birth, exiting academia (e.g., mortality and prospects of survival), academic kinship (mentorship ties and supervision, collaboration), Crude Migration Intensity, Migration Effectiveness Index and the Aggregate Net Migration Rate)
        - Network analysis of scientific collaborations
        - Text analysis of bibliometric information
5.	Structure of workshop (**3 hours 45 minutes**):
