# Workshop on "Using bibliometric data in demographic research"

1. Workshop title: **Using bibliometric data in demographic research**

2. Organizers:
    - **Aliakbar Akbaritabar** (primary contact person, akbaritabar@demogr.mpg.de), Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research (MPIDR), GitHub: [https://github.com/akbaritabar](https://github.com/akbaritabar)
    - **Xinyi Zhao** (zhao@demogr.mpg.de), Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research (MPIDR), University of Oxford, GitHub: [https://github.com/zxy919781142](https://github.com/zxy919781142)

3.	Description of workshop objectives, goals, and expected outcomes. 
    - Overview of literature on using bibliometric data for demographic research and potential research projects and some of the newest bibliometric applications
    - Introduction to available data sources, especially publicly available data
    - Introduction to handling bibliometric data for demographic research: data retrieval, data pre-processing and repurposing based on research questions
    - Discussion about potential limitation and future directions of bibliometric data in demographic research

4.	Statement on how the workshop can benefit attendees. 
    - Familiarize themselves with the availability of bibliometric data as a type of digital data and its potentials for demographic research
    - Familiarize themselves with the most commonly used and available bibliometric databases
    - Learn about pre-processing steps and handling bibliometric data, including: 
        - Author/organisation name disambiguation 
        - Gender identification
        - Scholarly mobility and movement identification

           (comment 1: I think detecting missing countries, detecting research disciplines are more necessary pre-processing steps / gender and mobility are perhaps optical steps, not necessary for most research) 
    - Learn about practical applications of bibliometric data in demographic research, including:
        - Use of some relevant scientometric indicators
        - Calculation and use of demographic indicators (e.g., Crude Migration Intensity, Migration Effectiveness Index and the Aggregate Net Migration Rate)
        - Network analysis of scientific collaborations
        - Text analysis of bibliometric information
           
           (comment 2: I for the second points, all the indicatirs list are all for mobility research, a part of demographic research. Is there any common demographic indicator we can list here? ) 
5.	Structure of workshop (**3 hours 45 minutes**):
    1. Overview of literature on using bibliometric data for demographic research and potential research projects (**30 minutes**)
    2. Panel discussion (**90 minutes**) - invited speakers:
        - Emilio Zagheni, MPIDR: Benefits, strengths, weaknesses and pitfalls of using bibliometric data for demographic research
        - Andrea Miranda Gonzalez, UC-Berkeley: Internal migration in Mexico
        - Asli Ebru Sanlitürk, MPIDR: Brexit’s effect on scholarly migration to and from the UK
        - Maciej J. Dańko, MPIDR: Development and international scholarly migration
        - Tom Theile, MPIDR: Trends of return international migration worldwide
        - Xinyi Zhao, MPIDR: Gender perspective in international scholarly migration
        - Aliakbar Akbaritabar, MPIDR: Integrating internal and international scholarly migration worldwide
        - Followed by an open discussion between speakers and Q&A.

           (comment 3: I was thinking it i more likely Bibliometric for migration study, all the small talk here are about migration, not covering other topics in demography ) 

    3. Introduction to available data sources, especially publicly available data (**30 minutes**)

           (comment 4: my view is put it earlier, at least let the audience know the structure of the data) 

    5. Introduction to handling bibliometric data for demographic research: data retrieval, data pre-processing and repurposing based on research questions (**60 minutes**)
    6. Conclusion and discussion of potential limitations and future directions of using bibliometric data in demographic research (**15 minutes**)

6.	Description of target audience and estimated number of participants (minimum and maximum). 
    - Postgraduate students, early career researchers, those interested in high-skilled and scholarly mobility/migration and those interested in science of science, bibliometrics, scientometrics and informetrics. (Minimum 10 and maximum 25 participants)

7.	Proposed workshop duration (1/2 day, 1 day, 1.5 day, 2 day), format, activities, and schedule. 
    - 1/2 day. Lecture, dialogue and discussion with participants, hands-on session with data and software

8.	Short biographical sketches of presenters, link to current CVs.
